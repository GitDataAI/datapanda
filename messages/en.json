    "collaborationDes": "Pull requests have their place, but sometimes you just want to work together in real-time. It’s not only more fun, but it also builds trust within the team and is one of the best ways to distribute knowledge. Collaboration should be as simple as sending a message to bring someone into your working session and start solving problems together.",
    "Conversations": "Conversations should happen close to the data",

    "CollaborativeDes": "DataPanda is collaborative. Similar to how many people can work on a design file at the same time, multiple people can work on the same dataset at the same time. We modeled our pull request workflow after Git. A user can make a change, create a pull request to be reviewed by a member of the team, and then merge the changes to the 'main' or 'production' branch. If conflicts arise from two people making a change to the same cell or row, they can be viewed and resolved manually. Databases can be easily shared among many people without needing to ask which version is best.",
    "Innovation": "Innovation",
    "InnovationDes": "DataPanda is borderless. We wants to AI development more accessible to everyone. The best part is that it's very difficult for beginners to make a major mistake. With easy rollback, any change can be undone. This means more people can be involved in the data process, and learn as they go.",
    "Transparent": "Transparent",
    "TransparentDes": "DataPanda is transparent. On DataPanda, commits and pull requests are a great way to document changes to data. They often include sources and motivation for changes, making data and where it came from more transparent. If someone makes a bad change, you can track it to the commit and revert it. Teach the offender what they did wrong so they don't make the same mistake again. We also have issues, where users can report bugs, feature requests, or other ways the data can be improved. This greatly minimizes guessing for why the data is the way it is.",
    "Community-driven": "Community-driven",
    "Community-drivenDes": "DataPanda is community-driven. Not only do we have a thriving community, but we have fostered a community of enthusiastic data hunters and gatherers through data bounties. We pay people to find data and put it in the JZFS format. These datasets are completely open to the public and free to download and share. Our data bounty participants have created 10 sought-after and relevant datasets so far, with more to come. Participants learn technical skills through this process, while getting paid for their contributions.",
